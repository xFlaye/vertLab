[This Asset is a sample project for learning pruposes]

To properly import this Asset into a project:

1- Import text mesh pro in the package manager window

2- Read the scripts if you want to add fractals into a new scene, the scripts have comments, so it will be easier to understand the code


You can find information about the fractals in the internet, the cantor set is one of the easiest of this Asset, it only needs to change the size of the 2 resultant lines

--Koch fractal: This fractal is created by spawning triangles in the 3 sides of the first triangle.

The first iteration spawns a triangle in the middle. 

The second iteration does the same in the free space at the sides of the first triangle,

that is how I made work the Koch fractal.

--Vicsek fractal: Spawns all the content of the fractal in 4 positions, up, down, right and left.

The first iteration only duplicates the cross, in the rest of iterations, it spawns the result of the last iteration.
